**Reinforcement Learning**

RL is known as a semi-supervised learning model in machine learning which enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.

Unlike supervised learning where the feedback provided to the agent is correct set of actions for performing a task, RL uses rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative behavior. Thus, its goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent.
